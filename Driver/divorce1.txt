age: 17 gender: female
when i was younger, my dad was barely in the picture.
it was normal for him to leave for a couple of days and then come home.
he wanted to go out and have fun
but he also had to help make a living for my mom, siblings, and i.
so i don’t blame him. 
the day my mom left him, 
i thought it was just another one of those days 
[she apologizes for getting all worked up and swallows before continuing]
where we would head out and come home the following day. 
it wasn’t until my mom met my step dad 
that i finally accepted that my biological dad wouldn’t be coming home.
so looking back on it, 
my life totally changed the day we left. 
[tell her a similar story you know of]
[ask her "how did it change?"]
