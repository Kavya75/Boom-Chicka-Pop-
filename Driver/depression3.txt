until finally i looked around and saw:
i had my friends next to me, there for me. 
depression isn’t something that will ever go away for me, 
but things are a lot better now. 
after the worst of my depression passed, 
i started growing happier and brighter with the support of my friends and family. 
i am so thankful to say that
i have the best of friends who have stuck with me 
through my journey and struggles that made me the person i am today.
