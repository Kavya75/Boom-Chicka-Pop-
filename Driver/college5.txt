[he frowns, and his eyebrows furrow]
high school was tough and i was even tougher on myself
but life's not all about high school
and words can't fix everything
i appreciate the nice sentiments from everyone in my life
but i knew deep down that things weren't going to get better
because i wasn't changing myself enough at the time. 
[he stops himself from continuing to talk]
