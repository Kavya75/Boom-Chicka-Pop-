i was so stressed during those two years 
people would always tell me that 
there will always be second chances
but this was my second chance; 
i couldn't afford to fuck it up 
i studied so hard all the time -- 
some days, i would study over eight hours in a row
the truth was, i was never dumb
i knew my strengths lay in math and science
i was good at coding and not half bad at math; 
my failing grades were a product of my apathy 
but for two years, i managed to survive this way 
by burying my head into the books and nonstop studying
i managed to keep up a GPA 
[say that it's at least nice to have to worry less than in hs]
[congratulate him]
