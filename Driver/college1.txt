[he looks clean, young, and smart]
i used to have depression in high school
my degrading mental health impaired my grades
and i was doing worse and worse
but there was no way out of it 
my parents weren't very involved in my life
and my friends mostly didn't understand what it was like 
[he takes a deep breath] 
i know they were trying to help, but they'd say things 
that made me feel even more despair
i never did quite believe them when they said 
"things will get better"
[insist that despite his beliefs, things do improve]
