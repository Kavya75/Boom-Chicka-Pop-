in order to go to a good school
i would have to take the bus for two hours
but it meant having to wake up at around 4 am 
i'd ride alone, stay at school for the entire day,
and then head back.
i remember reading my textbooks front to back,
back to front,
until the pages were all yellowed and i'd 
drawn all over the book...
in order to succeed, you had to push yourself.
i wasn't an exceptional student,
i was what people expected from the youth
[express outrage at how ridiculous and stressful that sounds]
