but i knew that my real dad wasn’t coming back, 
so i learned to move on and accept and be thankful for what is around me. 
my relationship with my biological dad is great:
i visit him often
and my relationship with my step dad is great too.
he loves my siblings and i endlessly. 
after we settled in with my step dad, 
i finally realized that a dad doesn’t have to be blood related.
a dad is someone who 
takes care of you, 
spoils you, 
and loves you--
the same way a biological parent does.
