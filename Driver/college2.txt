when i applied for college
i knew my gpa was too low to get any good colleges 
but i still went through the application process 
to hide how much i was struggling from my peers
[he takes another deep breath and looks up for a moment] 
in the end, i got all the rejections i expected
sometimes, i think it was a waste of effort to apply--
or at least, it was a waste of effort to worry so much 
about what my peers would think.
[he mumbles to himself: all of that seems so trivial now]
i ended up going to community college as the one near me 
offered a guaranteed transfer to one of the UCs after two years 
--with the caveat that i had to keep my grades up of course
[reassure him that there's no shame for struggling more than peers]
[prompt him to continue]
