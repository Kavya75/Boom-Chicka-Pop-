[she continues, talking slower now]
[you nod to encourage her]
i had to change schools multiple times
my mom was struggling to make money to put a roof over our heads. 
and because i moved, i had to leave my old friends. 
i had to leave the fun things my brother and i did growing up. 
we saw our cousins less because we lived further away. 
We didn’t have sleepovers anymore, 
and we didn’t wake up at 7 am excited for the disney shows. 
...stuff like that. 
[express sorrow over her lost childhood]
[offer silence as your main form of consolation]
