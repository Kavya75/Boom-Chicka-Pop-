I had to change schools multiple times
my mom was struggling to make money to put a roof over our heads. 
and because I moved, I had to leave my old friends. 
I had to leave the fun things my brother and I did growing up. 
We saw our cousins less because we lived further away. 
We didn’t have sleepovers anymore, 
and we didn’t wake up at 7 am excited for the Disney shows. 
Stuff like that.
