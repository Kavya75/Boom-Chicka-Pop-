in the end, i tested into one of the top colleges
in the entire nation.
but my mom, who was a teacher at a professor at another college
wanted me to stay close to home and go to that college
it wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't come close in prestige
but i decided to listen to her and attend her college
in retrospect, i don't regret doing so
but a part of me will always wonder about all the 
what if's 
--and not just in relation to college.
what if i had grown up differently, in america
what if i had spent more of my youth having fun
rather than just studying all day?
