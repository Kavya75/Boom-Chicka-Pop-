but when i told them 
they were so supportive
maybe even too supportive
they forced me to go to a therapist 
even though i didn't want to talk to a stranger about my issues
it didn't feel like it was going to help 
but the goal of the therapy session was simple:
for my parents and i to sit together
and try to better understand each other's point of views 
but telling them forced me to overcome multiple fears:
fears of getting help, of confronting the truth about my depression.
getting help required me to first acknowledge that i needed help
and there was nothing wrong with that
