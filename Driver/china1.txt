i grew up in china at a time where
everyone i knew lived on barely enough
we lived in cramped apartments that we shared with other families
and could only buy certain amounts of alloted food a week
it was a much different china than it wa now. 
but if anything, people valued education 
just as much as they do now 
[mention that you've read about the shift in china]
