in my head, i knew there was no reason to be afraid
my parents were understanding
they were second generation chinese parents which meant 
they were much more westernized than most other of my peers' parents
they had always listened to my struggles before
and my older sisters had gone through similar struggles 
but those were a result of stress
i felt like there was nothing inherently wrong --
my family lived comfortably, i lived in a good area--
but yet, i was unhappy
[thank them for the conversation]
